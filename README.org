A small utility to generate [[https://github.com/ftilmann/latexdiff][LaTeX diffs]] from [[https://orgmode.org][Org files]].

* Installation
  Install by cloning this repository and from the root directory
  issuing:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    gem install org-diff
  #+END_SRC

* Usage
  To generate the LaTeX diff between two Org files, issue
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    org-diff fileA.org fileB.org
  #+END_SRC

* Development
  After checking out the repo, run =bin/setup= to install
  dependencies. You can also run =bin/console= for an interactive
  prompt that will allow you to experiment.

  To install this gem onto your local machine, run =bundle exec rake
  install=. To release a new version, update the version number in
  =version.rb=, and then run =bundle exec rake release=, which will
  create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and
  push the =.gem= file to [[https://rubygems.org][rubygems.org]].
